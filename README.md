# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description

This note taking app is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, and deployed to Heroku. Users are able to add and delete notes as they wish.

A challenge I faced when building this app was routing the server correctly. I originally forgot to use the api route, but managed to get it working after a while, and the app is now fully functional!

## Installation

To install this project locally, git clone the project, and then run 'npm i' to install the necessary dependancies for the app to work. Also make sure when you start the server with 'node server.js' that you are loading the browser of choice to local host port number 3333.

## Usage

Being a note taking application, using it is pretty straight forward. Thanks to a pretty simple user interface, users can navigate between the add note and delete note buttons with ease.
